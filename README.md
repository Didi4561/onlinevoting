VOTER'S REGISTERATION
There are a number of different ways that voters can register for an online electronic voting system (OEVS) of a presidential election. Some of the most common methods include:

* Online voter registration:** Many states now allow voters to register to vote online. This can be done by visiting the state's voter registration website and completing an online form.
* **Mail-in voter registration:** Voters can also register to vote by mail by completing and returning a voter registration form to their state election office.
* **In-person voter registration:** Voters can also register to vote in person at their local election office or at a designated voter registration site.


When registering to vote for an OEVS, voters will typically need to provide the following information:
* Their name
* Their date of birth
* Their residential address
* Their mailing address (if different from their residential address)
* Their driver's license number or state ID number (if they have one)
* Their signature

Once a voter has registered, they will be assigned a unique voter ID number. This number will be used to identify the voter and to verify their eligibility to vote.
